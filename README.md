## Challenges in Current DeFi Bots: Complexity, Security, and Usability Issues

Many existing DeFi bots, such as Banana Gun and Maestro, face several challenges that hinder their accessibility and effectiveness:

### 1. **Complexity**
   - The user interfaces (UIs) of these platforms are often overly complex and confusing, especially for beginners.
   - They are primarily designed for experienced traders, leaving new users behind.

### 2. **Security Risks**
   - Many platforms hold user funds, creating additional security risks, including the potential for hacks or misuse.
   - Trusting third-party services with funds can deter cautious users from engaging with these bots.

### 3. **Usability Issues**
   - Users are overwhelmed by too many features and options, making it difficult to focus on the core functionality they need.
   - Data presented by these bots is often unclear or insufficient, making it hard for users to make informed and smart trading decisions.

These challenges highlight the need for simpler, more secure, and user-friendly DeFi solutions that cater to a broader audience.
